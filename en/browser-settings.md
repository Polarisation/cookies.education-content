# Browser Settings for Cookies

We’ve seen that cookies can be controlled on individual websites, but this is time-consuming and requires us to place a large amount of trust in the website operator.

Web browser applications offer some settings that may help us manage cookies. Note that it is usually best to install [browser plugins](Browser Plugins) too, but nevertheless it is helpful to understand the built-in settings in your browser.

Each browser offers different settings for managing cookies. Some of these settings are available in all browsers, others only in some browsers.

The following table summarises the cookie settings available in popular browsers:

| Browser                                  | Firefox  | Chrome   | Edge     | Safari   | Opera    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Clear all cookies                        | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| Delete cookies when browser closes       | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| Block cookies for a website              | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| View number of cookies per website       | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| View cookie data (in settings)           |          | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| View cookie data (using web inspector)   | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| Delete cookies from a specific website   | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| Send “Do Not Track”                      | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?
| Tracking Protection                      | ✓        | ?        | ?        | ?        | ?

You may click on any browser in the table to learn how to use the settings for that browser.

Below, we describe each of the settings that may be available.

### Clear all cookies
Browsers should allow you to clear all your Cookie data. This can save space and removes any tracking cookies. For example, I found in Firefox my “Cookie & Site Data” was using 350MB (enough space to store an episode of a TV show). The downside of clearing cookies is that you will be logged out of many websites.

### Delete cookies when browser closes
If you select this option, your browser will remove any cookies when you close the browser. Assuming you close the browser regularly, this will block a lot of tracking, because any tracking cookies will have to be placed again after the browser has been restarted. You will also have to log into websites each time you start your web browser.

### Block cookies for a website
Some browsers allow you to block specific websites from placing cookies on your computer. You could use this if you are concerned about being tracked by a particular website.

### View number of cookies per website
Browsers will commonly allow you to view which websites have placed cookies on your computer, the number of cookies, the amount of storage, and the last time the website was used.

### View cookie data (in settings)
In addition to viewing cookie stats per website, some browsers allow you to inspect the data held within those cookies.

### View cookie data (using web inspector)
In some cases, it is not possible to view cookie data in the browser settings. However, you can do this using the web inspector, a tool provided for web developers. This makes it a little more difficult to inspect cookie data, but still possible.

### Delete cookies from a specific website
Browsers typically allow you to remove the cookies for a particular website. Using the web inspector, you could remove specific cookies.

### Send “Do Not Track”
Browsers can send a “Do Not Track” signal to websites (as a HTTP Header). This is a convention used to tell websites that you do not wish to be tracked. However, it requires you to trust the website operator to follow this instruction, and not all do. So it is not truly effective at blocking tracking. However, the more responsible companies can take it as useful feedback if many people have Do Not Track enabled, so you may like to enable this feature.

### Tracking Protection
Tracking protection provides some mechanism for blocking tracking cookies (and other tracking methods). In-built tracking protection is often not as powerful as the protection provided by browser plugins, however it can still be fairly effective.
