# Types of Cookies

It is common to categorise cookies according to their purpose. You may see this in Privacy or Cookie policies, or on Cookie Consent forms. There is no standard way of categorising cookies, but this page describes some of the common categories you may read about.

### Functional Cookies

The term "Functional cookies" typically means that these cookies support core functionality of the website, for example helping to remember your shopping cart or make payments on an e-commerce website.

### Security Cookies

"Security cookies" are typically used to safeguard against hacking attempts, eg. protecting your user account against possible theft. These are typically required in order to use a website as intended and so could be grouped with Functional Cookies.

### Analytical Cookies

"Analytical cookies" typically refer to cookies used to gather statistics about visitors to a website, for analysis purposes. These cookies are typically non-essential: you could block the cookies and the website would still function. Analytical cookies typically track you as a user, but you wouldn't expect them to be shared with advertisers (however, you can't be sure unless you check privacy & cookie policies).

### Marketing / Advertising Cookies

Marketing or advertising cookies are used to gather data on your so that adverts can be targeted based on your browsing history. They are typically "third-party" cookies used across many websites to gather as much data as possible. These are some of the most concerning cookies because of the amount of data collected through their use. You can read more about these on our page [Third-Party Cookies](./third-party-cookies.md).

### Social Cookies

These are places by social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc when a widget (button, video, etc) from that website is included on the site you are viewing. They may support functionality of the widget, but they are often used to track you for advertising purposes too, so could be groups with "Advertising Cookies" above.

## What about "Critical" or "Essential" cookies?

These terms are less clear as they do not describe their purpose. A sensible assumption would be that they describe Functional and/or Security Cookies, but be careful, they might be cookies that the website operator considers "essential" but you wouldn't, like tracking cookies to increase advertising revenues!

## What about "Session Cookies"?

Session cookies are actually a special category, because they are not arbitrary - they are technically different from other cookies. When a website installs a session cookie, it will only be kept during the "current session" - which typically means until you close your browser. This means they cannot be used for long term tracking. They are typically used for temporary functionality, like login or keeping a shopping basket.
