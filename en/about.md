# About Cookies.education

## Our Story

All over the web, you’ll see notices or prompts about cookies. But how many people really understand what cookies are, and how to control them?

Cookies.education was created so that typical users of the web can better understand what web cookies are, why they matter, how to control your browsing experience and protect your privacy. We wanted to create a resource not only for tech-savvy millennials, but their parents too!

Before we started, we found there were already a number of websites out there that explain Cookies. However, we found they were lacking in many ways.

## Up-to-date information

Firstly, many existing sites explaining cookies were out of date. Not only did they look and feel dated, but the information on them had not been updated for years. Whilst the fundamental technology around cookies has not changed in a significant way in many years, the environment in which they are used has changed drastically. There are new laws in many countries regulating the use of cookies, and influenced by these, new techniques (“dark patterns”) used by companies to persuade the user to accept these cookies. There are also technological changes: browser settings and been updated and improved, and new browser add-ons have been developed to help users control cookies. 

Cookies.education is up-to-date for the 2020s. We take into account the implications of the latest technologies, laws, and industry practices, which were not covered by other websites about cookies. And we want to continue to be provide up-to-date information, so we’re [accepting contributions from readers](./contributing.md) to help improve and update these resources.

## Protecting your privacy

Secondly, we found that many of the other websites about cookies were themselves installing third-party tracking cookies for visitors of their websites (the kind that many people have privacy concerns about). Some of these sites are not even complying with modern cookie laws (perhaps because they haven’t been updated in years). 

We don’t feel it’s right to install tracking cookies for users who are visiting the site to learn about cookies, who may not yet understand what cookies are and their implications - at that stage, they are not able to make an informed decision. That’s why we decided Cookies.education will not use any tracking cookies, and in fact we go further and install no cookies of any kind. So you don’t need to accept cookies to learn about cookies!

## Clear information in the user’s interest

Finally, we noticed many of the existing websites about cookies were not easy to understand, and were often biased in the interests of the influential advertising industry (because they were earning money from this industry).

On Cookies.education we aim to make cookies easy to understand, and more importantly, we want you to understand the privacy implications and the choices you can make to protect your privacy. We don’t take any money from advertising. Advertising companies would think we are biased, and they’d be right. We are biased: in the interests of everyday users of the web.

If advertising companies become less profitable as a consequence of educating users about cookies and privacy, so be it. We’d love to see a world wide web with less advertising, as we believe it’s a better user experience and better for our mental health when we are not constantly bombarded by advertisements. We encourage you to explore [Ad-free alternatives](https://github.com/johnjago/awesome-ad-free) and where you can afford to do so, pay for alternatives to support businesses and organisations that offer an ad-free experience. This might some unrealistic to some, but then I’d remind you that one of the most useful and loved websites in the world, WikiPedia, uses this model.
