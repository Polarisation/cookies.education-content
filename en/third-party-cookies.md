# Third party tracking cookies and how they are used by the advertising industry 

Web cookies can be used for many purposes. They are often used for purposes that most people will not object to, for example to support advanced functionality on websites, including login and online purchases. These cookies can be described and categorised in various ways, and you can read more about these on our page [Types of Cookies](./cookie-types.md).

The cookies that cause more concern are _third party tracking cookies_. There are two elements to these cookies, firstly that they are _third party_, and secondly that they are _tracking_.

## What are third party cookies?

When you visit a website, that website is the “first party”. For example, as you are reading this, Cookies.education is the first party. When you load a page on a website, typically the content on that page, such as text and images, is loaded from the first party. The website may also send you cookies, in which case these are “first party cookies”.

The “second party” is you, as a visitor to the site, but that is rarely talked about.

If some images, advertisements, videos, widgets, or code on the page are loaded from another website, that’s a “third party”. So if an image from “images.example.com” is shown, that’s a third party domain. There are many reasons websites might load from third party like this, and some of these are quite reasonable, for example to serve images or video more quickly, to provide a special feature like a map, or to take online payments. Often, using third parties can enhance the experience of visiting a website.

Another common reason that the page may have elements from a third party website is to show advertisements or track you (which we’ll get to shortly).

Third parties may send you cookies, for a variety of reasons, some innocent, some less innocent. A third party cookie might store your preferences, for example the volume you prefer to use when you watch a video. This would seem an innocent and useful purpose for third-party cookies.

So third party cookies are not always a privacy concern, however, they become a privacy concern if they are not only third party but also tracking.

## What are tracking cookies?

Tracking cookies include any cookies used to identify a user’s website visits over time. For example, most websites use some method of tracking user visits so that they can see how users are arriving at and using the website. Website owners want to know things like where traffic is coming from (search engines, website referrals, social media, or elsewhere), and how often users are returning to the website.

To do this, they usually place a cookie with a unique ID for that user, so they can recognise when the user returns in future.

First party-tracking cookies can be used to track visits to a single website, so that a website owner can view collective statistics on their visitors. Such a use of cookies would not surprise or concern most people.

If a website can identify individual users this may be more concerning. However it very much depends on the website. Let’s look at a few examples:

#### Furniture store

If an online furniture store collects information about which pages you visited, then they can infer which furniture items you are interested in. This might not be concerning at all - even your worst enemy probably could not do much with this information. However, there might still be cases when you value privacy, for example if you have bought an item as a gift for someone.

#### Medical website

Doctor-patient confidentiality is an foundational principle of our health services. But if you look up medical conditions on a website which is tracking you with cookies, the pages which you visited may indicate which medical condition you have or have concerns about. If you value doctor-patient confidentiality, you had better have confidence in the owners of this website: if they track you and hold data about your browsing history on the website, they should be able to store it securely, not share it with other companies, and keep it safe from hackers.

#### Online encyclopaedia

WikiPedia is a great resource with information on almost every topic you can imagine. Almost everyone uses it, and sometimes quite frequently. Your WikiPedia browsing history might reveal all kinds of things about you, including medical conditions, politic beliefs, favourite holiday spots, or your financial concerns. With your WikiPedia browsing history it may be possible to construct a detailed profile of your circumstances and interests, which you almost certainly would not want to make public.

Luckily, WikiPedia is funded by donations rather than advertising and has a responsible governing body, so we can be reasonably confident that our history is safe when using it.

But when you are tracked using **third-party** tracking cookies across many websites, advertising companies can still build up a profile about you across a wide range of topics.
 
## How do third party tracking cookies violate privacy expectations?

When using the web, you are typically focused on a task. For example, planning a holiday, looking up a medical condition, researching mortgage options, etc. You may start with a search engine like Google (or better-still, a privacy-focused search engine such as DuckDuckGo). When you land on a website that you found through the search engine, they will likely have privacy and cookies policies and provide some options to decide which third-party tracking cookies to accept, but if you read these and configure cookies you will add about an hour to your task for each new website you visit (assuming you have enough understanding of these topics to do this at all). If you visit ten websites whilst planning a weekend away, you’ve added perhaps 10 hours to a task which could have taken 1 or 2 hours. So in practice you won’t do it, and you probably won’t even think about it much, you’ll just dismiss the information about cookies and get on with your task.

A 2008 paper, [The Cost of Reading Privacy Policies](http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf), showed this more formally with an estimate of the total time required to read privacy policies in full at over 200 hours per year, which is a about 5 working weeks. It is clearly unfeasible to do so.

Companies know this and take advantage of it. They don’t expect you read their policies although they are asking you to agree to them. One time, when I did take the time to read website’s terms & conditions in full, half way through I found a they were offering a free t-shirt to anyone reading - knowing full well that only a tiny fraction of visitors would read this and claim the t-shirt! This was indeed amusing but highlights a serious point: most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to when we use online services.

It may be a common-sense expectation that a website you are visiting will gather some data about your visit for analysis. Third-party tracking is not a clear, common-sense expectation when you visit a website, but it is in fact the norm.Most websites which use advertising do use third-party tracking cookies, which are used to build a profile of your interests as you browse large areas of the web. Many people aren’t aware of this, or if they are, haven’t the time to do something about it using the opt-outs made available by the websites they are visiting (if any).

Legislators around the world have recognised the concerns around cookies (in particular third-party tracking cookies). Continue onto the next section to learn about your legal rights when browsing the web and how the use of cookies is regulated.
