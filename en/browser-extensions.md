# Browser Extensions for Controlling Cookies

If you wish to block third-party tracking cookies, the best way to do this is usually via browser extensions. Although some browsers have functionality built in, the top browser extensions for blocking third-party cookies are usually more effective.

Browser extensions are available for all major browsers. They may also be referred to as browser add-ons or browser plug-ins.

You may have heard of ad-blockers. Many browser extensions which serve as ad-blockers also block third-party tracking. Similarly, extensions that primarily exist to block trackers, also tend to block ads. Ad-blocking aims to protect the attention of the user, whereas tracker-blocking aims to protect the privacy of the user. Although the intentions of ad-blocking and tracker-blocking differ, the tools and techniques used tend to be the same. This is because there is so much overlap between the advertising industry and tracking on the web: the most common trackers are advertising companies.

Before you install a blocker, you should be aware that some popular ad-blockers are effectively paid for by the ad industry, and so they are not truly effective. One of the most popular AdBlock Plus, runs a scheme called Acceptable Ads. These are less-obtrusive ads which are not blocked by default by AdBlock Plus. AdBlock Plus charges large advertising companies in order to be whitelisted as Acceptable Ads. So installing AdBlock Plus will not block all advertisements, as you might have expected.

## Recommended Browser Extensions to block tracking

We recommend the following users for most users who wish to block third-party tracking cookies:

### uBlock Origin

uBlock Origin is one of the genuine blockers, which does not compromise in it's mission to block all third-party trackers. It remains entirely a volunteer effort and does not even accept donations, so as not to be compromised by the powerful advertising industry. Under normal usage, it works using lists of known trackers to block.

### Privacy Badger

Privacy Badger is developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit digital rights group. Privacy Badger works using algorithmic methods to detect and block trackers, rather than depending on lists of trackers. It can therefore work well when used alongside uBlock Origin (which depends on lists).
