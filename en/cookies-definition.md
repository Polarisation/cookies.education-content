A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your device when you access a website. The cookie will then be sent to the website every time you visit it.

You may sometimes see cookies described as "files". This may or may not be correct - the way that they are stored depends on the web browser that you are using. Each cookie might be stored as an individual file, or it might be stored in another format, for example in a database.

Initially when you hear about cookies, you might become concerned that websites can store data on your computer. On a modern computer this is really nothing to worry about, since cookies are very small. Having said that, when you visit many websites the space taken up by cookies can add up, so if you are running low on space you can consider [deleting cookies](./browser-settings.md).

The real concern about cookies is that they allow a website remember things about you (because they are sent back to the website when you visit it). Depending on how cookies are used, this may also be nothing to worry about. For example, if the cookie is storing your preferred currency when using an on-line store, this functionality is helpful to you as a user. But you might be concerned if the same website sets a cookie to identify you as a high income customer, and then shows you higher prices than other visitors.

You might be reading this because you want to know if cookies are good or "evil". Like most things in life, it's not that simple: it depends how they are used. Cookies can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including saving your preferences, keeping a virtual shopping cart, improving security, keeping you logged in, and tracking you to gather data.

Typically, people get most concerned about cookies that are used to track you and gather data, particularly where they are gathering large amounts of data. It is [third-party cookies](./third-party-cookies.md) that have the most potential to collect large amounts of data about you, because they may be used on multiple websites.

Even before cookies were first defined as a standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), they have been known to present a privacy concern. The original specification published by the IETF was explicit about the privacy issues, and set limitations on their use. Unfortunately by that time, web browsers were already using cookies beyond those limits, and this never changed. Third-party cookies became commonplace despite being disallowed by the specification.

Because of these privacy concerns, [various laws](cookie-rights.md) have been created around the world which govern the use of cookies. Generally these require users to be informed and in many cases, to give consent before they can be used. However, this doesn't solve all the concerns around cookies. Not every website complies with these laws. Even amongst websites which do comply, many have figured out how to persuade most users to give consent by making it much easier to approve rather than deny consent. It is therefore helpful to have a basic understanding of these laws:  the reasons they were put in place, the rights they give you, and their implications.

There are many ways you can [control how cookies](./controlling-cookies.md) are used when you browse the web. Some controls may be provided on the website itself in order to comply with cookie-related legislation. Other controls are available in your [web browser settings](./browser-settings.md). Further control can be gained by installing browser extensions.

On this website you can learn all about cookies and how to control them. We recommend effective [browser extensions](./browser-extensions.md) to install to protect your privacy and speed up your web browsing experience.
