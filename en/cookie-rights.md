# Your rights

In many countries, there are laws which cover the usage of cookies. Typically, cookies are not referred to by name, but laws will set rules for the storage of information on user devices.

Generally, laws that cover cookies will require:

 - Information to be provided on how cookies are used
 - In many cases, that the user's consent be gained prior to use.
 
Although these laws may not exist in every country, they are common enough internationally that you are likely to benefit from these laws, even if there is no such law in your country.

If you're interested to learn more about specific laws around the world, read on...

### The "EU Cookie Law" (2009)

In 2009, the European Union produced an "E-privacy" directive: [Directive 2009/136/EC](https://edps.europa.eu/node/3082). This became commonly known as the "EU Cookie Law". 

The directive itself was in fact not a law, but it was implemented in the national laws of countries in the European Union in 2011. It covered a wider range of topics, not only cookies, but the coverage of cookies meant that the web community came to know it as the "cookie law".

The use of cookies was covered in clause 66:

> Third parties may wish to store information on the equipment of a user, or gain access  to information already stored, for a number of purposes, ranging from the legitimate (such as certain types of cookies) to those involving unwarranted intrusion into the private sphere (such as spy­ware or viruses). It is therefore of paramount importance that users be provided with clear and comprehensive information when engaging in any activity which could result in such storage or gaining of access. The methods of providing information and offering the right to refuse should be as user-friendly as possible. Exceptions to the obligation to provide information and offer the right to refuse should be limited to those situations where the technical storage or access is strictly necessary for the legitimate purpose of enabling the use of a specific service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user. Where it is technically possible and effective, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Directive 95/46/EC, the user’s consent to processing may be expressed by using the appropriate settings of a browser or other application. The enforcement of these requirements should be made more effective by way of enhanced powers granted to the relevant national authorities.

This was then implemented into national laws in each country of the European Union. 

For example, in United Kingdom law, this was implemented as an amendment in 2011 to the [The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426) - section 6. 

    6.—(1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.
    (2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal equipment—
      (a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and
      (b) has given his or her consent.
    (3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are met in respect of the initial use.
    (3A) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which the subscriber uses or by using another application or programme to signify consent.
    (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or access to, information—
      (a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network; or
      (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber or user.

### General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) (2016)

In 2016, another European Union regulation came in that also applied to cookies. As with the earlier E-privacy directive, the GDPR was to be implemented in national laws before taking effect. It began to be applied in 2018. It does not replace the E-privacy directive but complements it.

GDPR is focused on protections for the processing of personal data. Therefore, it applies to cookies which are storing some form of personal data. This is actually quite common, because advertising IDs which uniquely identify a user would be considered as personal data.

Many companies paid more attention to GDPR than the E-privacy directive, in part because of the large fines that could be given to companies that do not follow the regulations.

In the United Kingdom, the GDPR was implemented in an updated [Data Protection Act (2018)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-protection-act-2018), which replaced the previous [Data Protection Act (1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998).

### California Consumer Privacy Act (2018)

The [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act) was signed into law in 2018, and began to be applied from January 1st 2020.

It is somewhat similar to the GDPR but applicable for residents of California in the United States.

Although it is only law in a single state, it indirectly sets a higher standard for the whole United States, since many companies will not want to provide services in different ways for different states.

### Other laws around the world

Many other countries have laws that impact the use of cookies, similar to those described above. More information can be found about [information privacy laws on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy_law);
