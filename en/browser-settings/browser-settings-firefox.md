# Controlling cookies in the Firefox web browser

Firefox has good support for controlling cookies. It also has a healthy ecosystem of [Browser Add-ons](../browser-plugins) which can add additional capability to controlling cookies.

#### How to clear all cookies in Firefox

1. Click the ![Firefox "Hamburger"](../../images/firefox-hamburger-menu.png) menu then click **Preferences**. Or **Firefox -> Preferences** in the macOS menu bar.
2. Navigate to **Privacy & Security -> Cookies and Site Data**
   ![Firefox "Cookies and Site Data" preferences](../../images/firefox-cookies-site-data-en.png)
3. Click **Clear data...**
   ![Firefox "Clear Data" panel](../../images/firefox-clear-data-en.png)
4. Ensure "Cookies and Site Data" is selected. Click **Clear**
5. You may find you have been signed out of some websites you use, and will need to log in again.

#### How to delete cookies when browser closes in Firefox

1. Click the ![Firefox "Hamburger"](../../images/firefox-hamburger-menu.png) menu then click **Preferences**. Or **Firefox -> Preferences** in the macOS menu bar.
2. Navigate to **Privacy & Security -> Cookies and Site Data**
   ![Firefox "Cookies and Site Data" preferences](../../images/firefox-cookies-site-data-en.png)
3. Check **Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed**
   ![Firefox "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" checkbox](../../images/firefox-delete-cookies-close-en.png)

From now on, every time the browser closes all cookies will be removed. This may mean you need to log in to websites more frequently. You'll be tracked for shorter periods, and save hard drive space.
