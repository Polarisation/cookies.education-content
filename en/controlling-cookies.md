# Controlling cookies

There are many decisions you can make to control which cookies you accept. Most websites now have a legal obligation to offer you choices, but these may not always be explained in full or in the clearest way because to do so may not be in-line with the website owner’s interests. 

If you are a website owner who does wish to explain all the options for controlling cookies, I encourage you to link to this page (or our homepage) from your cookies policy!

Cookies may be controlled via options on the website itself, via settings in your browser, or using browser plugins.

## On individual sites

Many websites, particularly those using third-party cookies, will have a cookie notice, often with a consent form.

Here are some examples:

TODO - simple notice screenshot
This example gives a simple notice about cookies. You can dismiss it, and there is a link to the cookies policy, but no options are available. This may be appropriate for some websites, but is typically not considered adequate for websites using third-party tracking cookies.

TODO - consent form screenshot
This example gives options in a consent form. You will notice that whilst it is very easy to accept all cookies, it is more difficult to reject all the optional cookies. Whilst you might be willing to invest time reviewing these settings for a website you use regularly, you probably won’t want to do this for a new site you are visiting for the first time: before you have used the site and decided if it’s useful enough to return to in future. The result is that most people will accept all cookies on most websites due to time constraints.

Since it is not realistic to spend time reviewing the cookies policy or filling out a consent form for every website you visit, you may wish to find a more general purpose solution using browser settings or browser plugins.

## Settings in your web browser

Whichever application you use to browse the web, whether it be Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, or another browser, you will find some options in the settings to control cookies. You can delete cookies, and depending on the browser you use, there may be some options available to block cookies. See our page on Browser Settings for more on the available settings in desktop and mobile web browsers.

## Browser plugins

In most browsers, the browser settings for controlling cookies are limited. Even if the browser does provides advanced features for blocking tracking cookies, these features may not be as powerful as they could be.

You can enhance the web browser using plugins (also known as extensions or add-ons) to block non-essential tracking cookies, protect your privacy, and speed up web pages. See our page on Browser Plugins for more details and some recommendations.
